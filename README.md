## Anomaly application:
Situations like laptop/phone/delicate things put on the bed table without looking at
the threshold balance of the table on the bed. So, there is a need to get an active
alert via buzzer/blink of Nordic Thingy:91or alert on a nearby device like a
phone/Bluetooth speaker like Alexa.
The balance track from onboard accelerometer and act on it via actuation of onboard
led & buzzer.
## Working station alertness:
Sometimes, the multiple chargers dissipate heat due to overcharge/electricity fault,
which generates fumes from the device body cover. A similar situation can occur
while electronics prototyping on the workstation.
These situations can be detected from temperature and air quality sensors onboard
which further act using relay control to control AC power with combination alert of
LED and buzzer.
## Personal environment automation:
Like control room temperature via fan or heater and air quality check around with
active actuation led notification to remind fresh air from window opening and close
on threshold of air quality value.
```
Depending on the deadline, 
I would further apply the edgeImpulse application to train Nordic Thingy:91 and use its cellular IoT/CPS applications in the situations described above.
